# Mobile Robotics Project 2

An autonomous vehicle with Lidar will be developed as a group project as part of
the [FHGR BSc Mobile Robotics](https://fhgr.ch/mr).

## Goals of the Tank

### Modes of Operation

The tank will feature three different control modes:

* In manual mode, the user will utilize a laptop GUI to control the tank using arrow keys. While in this mode, the lidar
  will be active but won't map the room.
* The automatic exploration mode will scan the room and create a map of the surroundings. The live progress will be
  displayed in the laptop GUI.
* Once the mapping is complete, the third mode can be activated. In this mode, the camera will be enabled and will
  search for QR codes. Upon finding one, the gun will shoot at the QR code.

### GUI

The GUI will likely be developed using rqt. It will include a manual control interface for steering the tank, as well as
several buttons to switch between different modes. To provide a visual representation of the scanned room, the current
live map will be displayed within the GUI. Additionally, the GUI will show the tank's current location, speed, and
direction of movement.

### Mapping

The mapping process will be conducted in 2D. However, it's important to note that the map will not be saved after the
tank is powered off.

## Architecture

### Structure

The software will be roughly structured along these boundaries:

```mermaid
graph TD
  Controller -->|"move command<br/>message: <code>geometry_msgs/Twist</code><br/>topic: <code>/cmd_vel</code>"| MC

  MC[ Movement Controller ]
  MC -->| PWM signal| LM[[ Left Motor ]]
  MC -->|PWM signal | RM[[ Right Motor ]]

  Controller -->|"fire command<br/>service: <code>FireAt</code><br/>request:<code>geometry_msgs/Point</code>"| GC
  GC[ Gun Controller ] -->| PWM signal| GS
  GC -->| Trigger signal | GT
  GS[["Gun Servo (height adjust)"]]
  GT[[ Gun Trigger ]]

  LIDAR[[LIDAR ]] -->|"point cloud<br/>message: <code>sensor_msgs/LaserScan</code><br/>topic: <code>/scan</code>"| Controller
  Camera[[ Camera ]] -->|"image<br/>message: <code>sensor_msgs/Image</code><br/>topic: <code>/image</code>"| IP
  IP[ Image Processor ] -->|"target information<br/>message: <code>geometry_msgs/PointStamped</code><br/>topic: <code>/target</code>"| Controller
```

Note that various helper ROS nodes are not (yet) shown here. Only the main components are shown.

When running in a simulator ([gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/)) the movement controller and gun controller will be
replaced
by a simulator version thereof which will then interact with gazebo rather than the real hardware.

Convention used (& invented) for this diagram:

* Hardware is rendered like this:
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
      A[[Some Hardware]]
  ```
* Software (each box is a [ROS node](https://wiki.ros.org/Nodes)) is rendered like this:
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
      A[Some Software]
  ```

### State

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> M: turn on
    M --> A: switch to automatic
    A --> M: switch to manual
    M --> S: switch to QR code search
    S --> M: switch to manual
    S --> G: target identified
    G --> M: shot fired

    M: Manual Control (remote)
    A: Automatic Exploration (Mapping)
    S: QR Code Search
    G: Gun Mode (shoot at target)
```

## Working With This Repository

As this repository contains code for [ROS](https://ros.org/) (specifically, ROS noetic, the last 1.x release) and uses
the [catkin](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) build tool, you'll need to work in a catkin workspace.

1. Source your ROS setup script (you should preferably add this to your `~/.profile`, esp. if you're working with an
   IDE!)
   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
   ```
2. Create a new folder for your new catkin workspace (note: you can have multiple catkin workspaces in parallel and also
   source all of their `setup.bash` files at the same time, that works fine):
   ```bash
   cd <wherever you want to have your workspace>
   ```
3. Clone this repository into the workspace and name the folder of the repository `src`:
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:rursprung/fhgr-mrproj2.git src
   ```
   Notes:
   * If you cloned it without specifying `src` at the end it'll create a folder named after the repository,
     i.e. `fhgr-mrproj2` - just use `mv fhgr-mrproj2 src` to fix this.
   * If you cloned it without specifying `--recurse-submodules` you can still manually init the submodules:
     ```bash
     git submodule init
     git submodule update
   * ```
4. Install all required dependencies:
   ```bash
   rosdep install --from-paths . -i
   ```
5. Build the workspace & source its setup file:
   ```bash
   catkin build
   source devel/setup.bash
   ```
6. Optional: when working with an IDE you should add the sourcing of the `setup.bash` of your workspace also to
   your `~/.profile` (same as the one from ROS) so that it's set for all sessions and your IDE can access it!

### Contributing To The Repository
If you intend to contribute to the repository, please make sure that you're using a fork rather than working directly in the upstream repository!
Follow the guide above to set up your repository and then:
1. Create your fork on GitHub if you haven't done so already
2. Go to your local clone of the repository:
   ```bash
   cd <your workspace>/src
   ```
3. Rename the remote `origin` to `upstream`:
   ```bash
   git remote rename origin upstream
   ```
4. Add your own fork:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <your fork URL>
   git fetch --all
   ```
5. Follow [the contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for further details.
